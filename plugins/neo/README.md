# Neo
#### A Matrix-like field type that uses existing fields

This is the Craft 3 development branch. The plugin is currently under heavy development so do not use it in your projects.


### State of the project
##### 8th April 2018

Many of you may have been wondering what has been happening with the development of Neo for Craft 3. I have missed the deadline I publicly set to have Neo ported to Craft 3, and I apologise if this has caused issues for you. That said,  expect to see the plugin ready within the week.

After Neo is ported I plan to port all my other plugins, in the following order -- Embedded Assets, No-Cache, Relabel, Quickfield, and Coordinates. Each of these plugins are orders of magnitudes less in size/scope than Neo, so I expect to have them ready sometime in the following week.

Thank you for your patience so far!

Ben.
